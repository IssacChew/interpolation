# Interpolation
## Linear interpolation between 2 points.

This program will interpolate a 3rd point when given 2 points. 
More specifically, it can give an interpolated x-point when given a y-point, or an interpolated y-point when given an x-point.

## Installation

Use a compiler such as Visual Studio's Developer command prompt. Assuming interp.c is in the folder, C:/interp, you would use this:
'''
cd c:/interp
cl interp.c
'''
After that, you can run the program on the command prompt or open the exe file.
